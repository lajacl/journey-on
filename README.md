## Inspiration
I have been desiring to make a trip application that provides uses assistance throughout the whole run of planning and taking a trip.
## What it does
Journey On ! is an Android based mobile app that provides the regular trip necessities including flight(s) and hotel. It also provides users with points of interest within the trip destination area. There is also a profile section customize the trip finding experience, and a way to see some trip inspiration.
## How I built it
Android Studio
## Challenges I ran into
MANY
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I always tend to over estimate what I can accomplish during hackathons, but I'm feeling good about what I was able to produce in the time I had available.
## What I learned
Where to begin: LOTS
Thank goodness for SDKs! And Amadeus had an amazingly well designed one.
## What's next for Journey On !
There are a bunch more features I would love to polish in the existing version, and many more that I want to add.
